## Instructions for Students

**Only most recent commit on the main branch of the online GitHub repository when the assignment is due will be graded**.
Your solution must use the `Rmarkdown` template provided in the assignment's repository that you cloned for this assignment. 
This means your answers will be compiled into a file called `assignment_answer.html` when you use the 'Knit' button in RStudio.
Failure to follow these steps and submit `assignment_answer.html` in your GitHub repository along with the `assignment_answer.Rmd`, will result in a assignment grade of **zero**.

Each group needs to appoint a **group leader**.
It is the group leaders job to "accept" the assignment via GitHub and then add all group members as collaborators to the group assignment.
To do this, the group leader will need each member's GitHub username.
The group leader can add group members as follows:

- Go to their group assignment repository on GitHub
- Click on the Settings tab
- Go to 'Manage Access'
- Click on 'Invite teams or people'
- Enter the GitHub usernames of each group member, one by one, and give them 'Write' access
- Click 'Add <username> to this repository'

Group members will then get an email to accept this invitation.
Group members **must accept** this invitation to be able to view and contribute to the assignment.

To work on this assignment, first clone the GitHub repository to your machine:

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/tisem-digital-marketing/2024-smwa-assignment-02-TEAMNAME.git
```

where you replace "TEAMNAME" with your group's team name.

After you have cloned the repository to your machine, the data is provided in the `data/` subdirectory.
Open an RStudio session and use this folder as a project.

Once the open, work on the assignment by adding your answers to `assignment_answer.Rmd` where marked.
Commit your changes periodically so that there is a record of the edits you are making.
To make your edits available to the rest of the group, you will want to push your commits to the online repository.
Do this with either: 

```{bash}
git push
```

from a terminal when your working directory is this folder, **or** use the Git pane inside RStudio (top right corner) to push using the green "up" arrow.

## Grading Information

* Points for each question are clearly marked in the answer document.
* Disputes over grades earned in the assignment must be made in writing, no later than 48 hours after their release. You must clearly state which questions you think are graded incorrectly.
* Disputes take the form of a request for the assignment to be regraded in **full.** Your grade may increase or decrease as a result of a regrade.
* The grading rubric used by the assessor is available in this repository
